\chapter{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}

In this paper, we described a~heightmap compression method designed to be a~plugin into an existing real-time planet renderer with its own rendering pipeline. The~method proved to be convenient for the~purpose, providing fast decompression (only about 1ms per block of data). Its compression ratio is comparable to C-BDAM, which is the~method with the~best compression ratio among the~methods for the~terrain compression, which guarantee a~maximum error bound adjustable by the~user.
